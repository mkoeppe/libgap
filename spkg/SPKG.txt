== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

LibGAP is essentially a fork of the upstream GAP kernel. It is
developed in its own repository at
https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/libgap. This is also where the spkg
metadata is tracked. To build a new spkg, use the spkg/make-spkg.sh
script in the repository.

Note that the repository in the spkg is just a dummy to make Sage
happy, any changes should be merged to the upstream repo.

=== libgap-4.5.5 (Volker Braun, 2 Sept 2012) ===
